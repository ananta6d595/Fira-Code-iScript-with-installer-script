# Fira-Code-iScript-with-installer-script
For arch Linux:
Just run .sh files this will install these fonts. These fonts are not mine, I have collected it for coding which is best for me. Just created script (which is also modified from another source I forgot!) for individual fonts to install correctly without hassel.

After download extract (ensure that .ttf files are present) then 
Step1: chmod +x install-FiraCodeiScript-Bold-archlinux.sh
Step2: ./install-FiraCodeiScript-Bold-archlinux.sh

(install other two are simillar fashoin)
